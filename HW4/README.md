# :dog: CSC 580 HW#4  Atari Pong

The goal of this assignment is to implement Deep Q-Learning Networks (DQN), and train the model that plays Atari Pong long enough until the agent plays as well as humans (hopefully)..

**Preliminary**

You should do this assignment on platforms that provides GPU support (and high RAM ideally) because it involves intensive computation.  Another issue is visualization (rendering color animation.  The code provided will run on **Google CoLab** but should be fine on most other platforms.


**Development Steps**

Your development consists of the following four steps.  Step 1 through 3 (inclusive) is a **preliminary phase** for completing the code.  Step 4 is the **formal experiment phase** to do further model training.

- Step 1. Complete "dqn_core.py"
- Step 2. Complete "Pong_train.ipynb"
- Step 3. Incorporate Hit_Count
- Step 4. Conduct formal further training and produce performance chart and video

Each step is throughly described in the
