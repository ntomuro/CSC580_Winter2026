# :robot: CSC 580 HW#2  Snake Game

This assignment is to code and run experiments with the Snake Game using a custom environment.  It consists of two parts, first to complete an agent who performs **Q-Learning**, and next to run experiments with the epsilon and gamma parameters.

**Part 1**.  Q-Learning Agent

- (1) The first task for this part is to complete the code for agent (class Agent in **"Agent.py"**).
- (2) The second task in this part is to train the agent and save the derived Q-table to a file.
- (3) The third task in this part is to evaluate the learned Q-table.

**Part 2**. Epsilon Experiment

- Your task for this part is to do some experiments.  The main focus is the exploration vs. exploitation tradeoff.  To that end, you run experiments with various epsilon values and compare results on several aspects.  
- Use the learned Q-table from Part 1 for this part.
