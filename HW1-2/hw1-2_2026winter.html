<h3 align="center">CSC 580: Artificial Intelligence II<br>Winter 2026</h3>

<h3>Homework #1-2: 
K-armed Bandits</h3>
<p>Part 2 of HW#1 is to implement the k-armed bandit example on
<a href="#1/1-RL-Bandits 16.pdf"><strong>Slide 16</strong> in lecture note (#1 
Multi-armed Bandits)</a>.</p>
<p>You are given a start-up notebook code -- "580_hw1-1_startup.ipynb" avaiable 
on Github,&nbsp; <a href="https://github.com/ntomuro/CSC580_Winter2026">https://github.com/ntomuro/CSC580_Winter2026</a>, under 'HW#1-2'.</p>
<p>Your job is to fill the parts/cells indicated in the code and ensure your 
outputs look similar to what's shown in the start-up code.&nbsp; <br>You must 
also create a short write-up document.</p>
<hr>
	<h3><strong>Deliverables</strong></h3>
	<p>Submit the following:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Your source code file (Jupyter notebook, in <strong>.ipynb format</strong>).&nbsp; 
		Make sure that you run the whole code at the end before submission so 
		that <strong>all outputs and displays are baked in the notebook file -- 
		you must ensure that (REQUIRED).</strong><br>
		&nbsp;</li>
		<li>A write-up document.
	<ul>
			<li><strong>Minimum 1.5 pages</strong> (in pdf of docx).</li>
			<li><span class="auto-style9">Your analyses on the results.&nbsp; 
			Write answers to these below.&nbsp; Your answer must be
			<span class="auto-style10"><strong>analytic</strong></span> to 
			receive a full score.&nbsp; Describe/verbalize your thinking and 
			reasoning process to reach your comment/conclusion.</span><ol class="style4">
				<li>Cell (3) 'Run the algorithm with various epsilons' -- 
				Discuss how the values for the three epsilons differ, and 
				explain the reasons why they turned out that way.</li>
				<li>Cell (4) Plot of average reward -- Describe your 
				observation.&nbsp; Also, why do you think the lines fluctuated 
				so much (i.e., not smooth)?</li>
				<li>Cell (5) Plot of optimal action -- Discuss what you can 
				conclude from the plot.</li>
				<li>Cdll (6) Initial Q-values -- Discuss how and why the output 
				values differ from the output from Cell (3).</li>
			</ol>
			</li>

			
</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>Your general reflections:<ul>
				<li>What you learned from this exercise.</li>
				<li>How difficult you felt this 
			exercise was.</li>
				<li>Any particular difficulties you encountered.</li>
				<li>How you 
		would do/approach differently next time (if there was one).</li>
				<li>and anything else. </li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
</ol>
	<p class="auto-style9"><span class="style3"><strong>IMPORTANT Reminder</strong></span>:&nbsp; Every code or 
	documentation file must have <strong><span class="auto-style11">your name</span></strong><span class="auto-style11">, the 
	</span> <strong><span class="auto-style11">course name</span></strong><span class="auto-style11"> (CSC 580) and the 
		</span> 
		<strong><span class="auto-style11">assignment number</span></strong><span class="auto-style11"> (HW#1-2) at the top of the file.&nbsp;
	</span> </p>
