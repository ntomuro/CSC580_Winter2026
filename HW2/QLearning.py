    This function simulates a RL game, where the agent learns the (hopefully) optimal policy
    by Q-learning.  The parameters 'agent' and 'env' are created in the calling function and
    passed in, while 'max_step' specifies the maximum timesteps to play (Note: continuous 
    after failing) and 'train' indicates the run is a training or otherwise (i.e., evaluation).
    Most lines are basic and general, calling functions in the environment or the agent.  
    Details depend on the implementations of those components (and their functions).
